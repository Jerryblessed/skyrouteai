# SkyRoute AI - Flight Optimization System

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Jerryblessed/fraudShieldgraphai/blob/main/fdetect.ipynb)

## üöÄ Inspiration

Air travel optimization is crucial for efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. We wanted to build a system that simplifies route planning, enhances decision-making, and integrates AI for smarter travel insights. Inspired by real-world airline challenges, SkyRoute AI leverages graph-based analytics to optimize flight paths dynamically.

## ‚úàÔ∏è What it does

SkyRoute AI processes flight and airport data using graph-based network analysis, allowing users to:

- Visualize flight routes and airport connections in ArangoDB.
- Find the shortest and most efficient routes between airports.
- Compute PageRank to determine the most influential airports.
- Use AI-powered NLP to AQL translation for querying flight data effortlessly.
- Integrate real-time graph visualization to display network structures.
